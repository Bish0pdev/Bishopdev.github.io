            <p>Hey Baby,</p>
            <p>I had this idea for a valentines gift for you, I hope you like it :]. I love you so much, and I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you. You are like, my whole world, and I am so happy to have you. I made this website in the hour and a half that you were in class, with no charger for my laptop lol. You are the most beautiful, smart, amazing girl I have ever met. I cannot wait to write the rest of our story together. It's going to be amazing, I know it. Thank you for loving, taking care of, and just being there for me over the last 5 years. I cant wait to be your husband, and life partner</p>
            <p>You are <b class="rainbow-text">Amazing</b> :]</p>
